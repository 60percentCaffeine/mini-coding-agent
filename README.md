# Mini-Coding-Agent

This folder contains a small standalone coding agent:

- code: `mini_coding_agent.py`
- CLI: `mini-coding-agent`

It is a minimal local agent loop with:

- workspace snapshot collection
- stable prompt plus turn state
- structured tools
- approval handling for risky tools
- transcript and memory persistence
- bounded delegation

The model backend is currently based on OpenRouter.

## Six Core Components

This coding harness is organized around six practical building blocks:

1. **Live repo context**  
   The agent collects stable workspace facts upfront, such as repo layout, instructions, and git state.
2. **Prompt shape and cache reuse**  
   A stable prompt prefix, which is separate from the changing request, transcript, and memory so repeated model calls can reuse the static parts efficiently.
3. **Structured tools, validation, and permissions**  
   The model works through named tools with checked inputs, workspace path validation, and approval gates instead of free-form arbitrary actions.
4. **Context reduction and output management**  
   Long outputs are clipped, repeated reads are deduplicated, and older transcript entries are compressed to keep prompt size under control.
5. **Transcripts, memory, and resumption**  
   The runtime keeps both a full durable transcript and a smaller working memory so sessions can be resumed while preserving important state via working memory.
6. **Delegation and bounded subagents**  
   Scoped subtasks can be delegated to helper agents that inherit enough context to help (but operate within limits).

## Requirements

You need:

- Python 3.9+
- an OpenRouter API key in `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`

Optional:

- `uv` for environment management and the `mini-coding-agent` CLI entry point

This project has no Python runtime dependency beyond the standard library, so you can run it directly with `python mini_coding_agent.py` if you do not want to use `uv`.

&nbsp;
## Configure OpenRouter

Create an OpenRouter API key and expose it in your shell:

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="..."
```

The default model is `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash`, DeepSeek V4 Flash on OpenRouter. You can choose any OpenRouter chat model with `--model`.

&nbsp;
## Project Setup

Clone the repo or your fork and change into it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rasbt/mini-coding-agent.git
cd mini-coding-agent
```

If you forked it first, use your fork URL instead:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-user>/mini-coding-agent.git
cd mini-coding-agent
```



&nbsp;
## Basic Usage

Start the agent:

```bash
cd mini-coding-agent
uv run mini-coding-agent
```

Without `uv`, run the script directly:

```bash
cd mini-coding-agent
python mini_coding_agent.py
```

By default it uses:

- model: `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash`
- reasoning effort: `xhigh` (max for DeepSeek V4 Flash)
- approval: `auto`

For a concrete usage example, see [EXAMPLE.md](EXAMPLE.md).

&nbsp;
## Approval Modes

Risky tools such as shell commands and file writes are gated by approval.

- `--approval auto`
  allows risky actions automatically, including arbitrary command execution and file writes by the model (default); use only with trusted prompts and trusted repositories
- `--approval ask`
  prompts before risky actions
- `--approval never`
  denies risky actions

Example:

```bash
uv run mini-coding-agent --approval auto
```



&nbsp;
## Resume Sessions

The agent saves sessions under the target workspace root in:

```text
.mini-coding-agent/sessions/
```

Resume the latest session:

```bash
uv run mini-coding-agent --resume latest
```


Resume a specific session:

```bash
uv run mini-coding-agent --resume 20260401-144025-2dd0aa
```


&nbsp;
## Interactive Commands

Inside the REPL, slash commands are handled directly by the agent instead of
being sent to the model as a normal task.

- `/help`
  shows the list of available interactive commands
- `/memory`
  prints the distilled session memory, including the current task, tracked files, and notes
- `/session`
  prints the path to the current saved session JSON file
- `/reset`
  clears the current session history and distilled memory but keeps you in the REPL
- `/exit`
  exits the interactive session
- `/quit`
  exits the interactive session; alias for `/exit`

&nbsp;
## Main CLI Flags

```bash
uv run mini-coding-agent --help
```

Without `uv`:

```bash
python mini_coding_agent.py --help
```

CLI flags are passed before the agent starts. Use them to choose the workspace,
model connection, resume behavior, approval mode, and generation limits.

Important flags:

- `--cwd`
  sets the workspace directory the agent should inspect and modify; default: `.`
- `--model`
  selects the OpenRouter model name, such as `openai/gpt-4o-mini`; default: `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash`
- `--base-url`
  points the agent at the OpenRouter-compatible API base URL; default: `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`
- `--api-key-env`
  names the environment variable containing the OpenRouter API key; default: `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
- `--openrouter-timeout`
  controls how long the client waits for an OpenRouter response (usually not needed); default: `300` seconds
- `--resume`
  resumes a saved session by id or uses `latest`; default: start a new session
- `--approval`
  controls how risky tools are handled: `ask`, `auto`, or `never`; default: `auto`
- `--max-steps`
  limits how many model and tool turns are allowed for one user request; default: `0` (no fixed step cap)
- `--max-new-tokens`
  caps the model output length for each step; default: `16384`
- `--reasoning-effort`
  controls OpenRouter reasoning effort: `off`, `none`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, or `xhigh`; default: `xhigh`
- `--temperature`
  controls sampling randomness; default: `0.2`
- `--top-p`
  controls nucleus sampling for generation; default: `0.9`

## Example

See [EXAMPLE.md](EXAMPLE.md)

## Notes & Tips

- The agent expects the model to emit either `<tool>...</tool>` or `<final>...</final>`.
- Different OpenRouter models will follow those instructions with different reliability.
- If the model does not follow the format well, use a stronger instruction-following model.
- The agent is intentionally small and optimized for readability, not robustness.
